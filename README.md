## Exploiting Neural Networkâ€™s Intelligence for Quantitative Trading

### Problem Statement
Historically, classical Time Series Modelling techniques e.g. ARIMA and GARCH were go-to machine learning tools employed by Quantitative Researchers to perform price predictions of financial instruments. Recently, their utility has been slowly diminishing due to their widespread use. The field is turning toward deep learning to improve market predictions and trading strategies. Overall, the past decade has seen many advancements in deep learning that fundamentally transformed all aspects of modern life. Neural networks also have shown a lot of potential in price predictions for stock trading. In this project, we attempt to model and predict prices of financial securities (including but not limited to stock indices and single stocks) with deep learning algorithms.
